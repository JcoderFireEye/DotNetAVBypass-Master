### DotNetAVBypass
This application was written in an attempt to be able to use penetration testing tools in an environment where Antivirus Systems may pick up your tools/payloads.  The Proof of Concept included, runs a Metasploit Meterpreter payload on the remote host, in a hidden window (can be called from the command line).

This solution was made with Visual Studio 2010, but should compile on anything as low as 2005 at least.  There are no special "unsafe" flags or anything required.
